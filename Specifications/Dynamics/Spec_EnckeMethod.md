# Specification for Orbit Propagation with Encke's Method

## 1.  Overview

### 1. functions
- The `EnckeOrbitPropagation` class calculates the satellite position and velocity with Encke's method, including disturbances and controlled accelerations by the satellite.
- This orbit propagation mode provides an accurate and efficient orbit calculation with disturbance forces.
- We can also use it for accurate relative orbit propagation, and the feature will be implemented soon.

### 2. files
- `src/dynamics/orbit/orbit.hpp, cpp`
  - Definition of `Orbit` base class
- `src/dynamics/orbit/initialize_orbit.hpp, .cpp`
  - Make an instance of orbit class.	
- `src/dynamics/orbit/encke_orbit_propagation.cpp, .hpp`
- We use [KeplerOrbit](./Spec_KeplerOrbit.md) libraries to calculate the reference orbit.

### 3. How to use
- Select `propagate_mode = ENCKE` in the spacecraft's ini file.
- Select `initialize_mode` as you want.
  - `DEFAULT`             : Use default initialize method (`RK4` and `ENCKE` use position and velocity, `KEPLER` uses init_mode_kepler)
  - `POSITION_VELOCITY_I` : Initialize with position and velocity in the inertial frame
  - `ORBITAL_ELEMENTS`    : Initialize with orbital elements
- Set the value of `error_tolerance`, which decides the threshold for the rectification.

## 2. Explanation of Algorithm
### 1. `EnckeOrbitPropagation::Initialize` function
#### 1. Overview
- This function generates the initial value of the reference orbit and the difference orbit.

#### 2. Inputs and outputs
- Input
  - $\mu$ : The standard gravitational parameter of the central body
  - $t$ : Time in Julian day
  - $\boldsymbol{r}_{i}$ : Initial position in the inertial frame
  - $\boldsymbol{v}_{i}$ : Initial velocity in the inertial frame
- Output
  - The reference orbit
  - The difference is set as zero

#### 3. Algorithm
- The reference orbit is initialized as the Kepler Orbit with `OrbitalElements::CalcOeFromPosVel` function. The detail of the function is described in [Specification for Kepler Orbit Propagation](./Spec_KeplerOrbit.md)

### 2. `EnckeOrbitPropagation::Propagate` function
#### 1. Overview
- This function is the main algorithm of Encke's method and calculates the orbit of the spacecraft.
- The method separates the orbit to the reference and the difference. The reference is calculated with the Kepler orbit method as a two-body problem, and the difference is calculated, including the disturbances.
  - $\boldsymbol{r}_{ref}$ : Reference orbit
  - $\boldsymbol{\delta}$ : Difference
- Please refer to the references to learn the original idea of Encke's method.

#### 2. Inputs and outputs
- Input
  - $\boldsymbol{a}_d$ : Acceleration
  - $t$ : Current time
- Output
  - $\boldsymbol{r}_{i}$ : Initial position in the inertial frame
  - $\dot{\boldsymbol{r}}_{i}$ : Initial velocity in the inertial frame
  
#### 3. Algorithm
1. Rectification
- If the norm of the difference is larger than the tolerance, we need to update the reference orbit as the latest orbit information.
2. Update reference orbit
- The reference orbit is calculated with the Kepler orbit calculation method.
3. Propagate the difference
- Propagate the following differential equation. At this moment, we use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method as a propagator.
```math
\begin{align}
  \ddot{\boldsymbol{\delta}} &= -\frac{\mu}{r_{ref}^3}(\boldsymbol{\delta}+f(q)\boldsymbol{r})+\boldsymbol{a}_d\\
  f(q) &= q \frac{q^2 + 3q + 3}{(1+q)^{1.5} + 1}\\
  q &= \frac{\boldsymbol{\delta}\cdot(\boldsymbol{\delta}-2\boldsymbol{r}_i)}{r_i}
\end{align}
```

## 3. Results of verifications

### 1. Comparison with RK4
#### 1. Overview
- We compared the calculated orbit result between RK4 mode and Kepler mode.
- In the Kepler mode, we verified the correctness of both initialize mode (`ORBITAL_ELEMENTS` and `POSITION_VELOCITY_I`).
  
#### 2. Conditions for the verification
- sample_simulation_base.ini
  - The following values are modified from the default.
    ```
    EndTimeSec = 10000
    LogOutPutIntervalSec = 5
    ```
- SampleDisturbance.ini
  - The disturbance setting is depending on the simulation case.
    - All disabled or enabled. Other settings are default.
- SampleSat.ini
  - The following values are modified from the default.
    - `propagate_mode` is changed for each mode.
    - Orbital elements for Kepler
      ```
      semi_major_axis_m = 6794500.0
      eccentricity = 0.0015
      inclination_rad = 0.9012
      raan_rad = 0.1411
      arg_perigee_rad = 1.7952
      epoch_jday = 2.458940966402607e6
      ```
    - Initial position and velocity (compatible value with the orbital elements)
      ```
      initial_position_i_m(0) = 1791860.131
      initial_position_i_m(1) = 4240666.743
      initial_position_i_m(2) = 4985526.129
      initial_velocity_i_m_s(0) = -7349.913889
      initial_velocity_i_m_s(1) = 631.6563971
      initial_velocity_i_m_s(2) = 2095.780148
      ```

3. Results
- The following figure shows the difference between orbit derived with Kepler mode initialized with OE and Encke mode without any disturbances.
  - The error is small (less than 10m), and we confirmed that the Encke propagation mode is correct when the disturbances are zero.

- The following figure shows the difference between orbit derived with RK4 mode and Encke mode with all disturbances.
  - The error is larger than the non-disturbance case, but the $10^4 [m]$ error between the Encke method and the Cowell method is compatible with the ref[2] when using the RK4 in LEO. We confirmed that the Encke propagation mode is correct when all disturbances are included.
