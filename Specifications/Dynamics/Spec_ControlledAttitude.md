# Controlled Attitude

## 1.  Overview

1. Functions  
   - `ControlledAttitude` class provides a perfectly controlled attitude instead of the free motion attitude dynamics by other numerical propagations. 
    - Users can set the attitude as sun pointing, earth pointing, and others for any direction in the spacecraft body frame. Of course , users can select an inertial stabilized attitude.
    - It is useful for power, communication, and orbit analyses with S2E.

3. How to use
   - Inside the codes
     - `ControlledAttitude` class inherits the `Attitude` class, so other functions can access the `ControlledAttitude` class by using get functions in the `Attitude` class.
   - User I/F
     - Firstly, users should set `propagate_mode = 1` at the ATTITUDE section in the `SimBase.ini` file and define file path to the `ControlledAttitude.ini` file.
     - Users can set a target attitude in the initialize file. There are the following setting parameters: `main_mode`, `sub_mode`, `quaternion_i2t`, `pointing_t_b`, and `pointing_sub_t_b`.
     - Firstly, users select the control mode by using `main_mode` and `sub_mode`. For the control mode, we have two categories, `INERTIAL_STABILIZE` and `POINTING`.  
     - When `main_mode` is set as `INERTIAL_STABILIZE`, `sub_mode` is ignored, and the spacecraft attitude is fixed to the `quaternion_i2t` value in the simulation.
     - When `main_mode` is set as `POINTING` modes, the direction of the body-fixed frame defined by `pointing_t_b` is controlled to point the specific direction of the modes. 
       - Ex. 1, the body-fixed +X axis directs to the sun when `main_mode = SUN_POINTING` and `pointing_t_b = [1.0,0.0,0.0]`.
       - Ex. 2, the body-fixed -Z axis directs to the earth center when `main_mode = EARTH_CENTER_POINTING` and `pointing_t_b = [0.0,0.0,-1.0]`.
     - `sub_mode` is only used when users select `POINTING` modes for `main_mode`. `sub_mode` is defined to stop rotation around the pointing direction of `main_mode`. The selected sub-direction in the body-fixed frame cannot perfectly direct the target direction since the primary target and sub-target usually don't satisfy the vertical relationship.
     - `sub_mode` cannot be `INERTIAL_STABILIZE` and the same mode with `main_mode`.
     - The angle between `pointing_t_b` and `pointing_sub_t_b` should be larger than 30 degrees. (90 degrees is recommended)
  - List of attitude control mode
    - INERTIAL_STABILIZE = 0
    - SUN_POINTING = 1
    - EARTH_CENTER_POINTING = 2
    - VELOCITY_DIRECTION_POINTING = 3
    - ORBIT_NORMAL_POINTING = 4
      - orbit normal $`n`$ is defined as $`n=r\times v`$, where $`r`$ is radial direction and $`v`$ is velocity direction.

      - Finally, both DCMs are combined as
        ```math
