# Specification for Orbit dynamics with RK4 propagation

## 1.  Overview

### 1. functions
- The `Rk4OrbitPropagation` class calculates the position and velocity of satellites with 4th Order Runge-Kutta method(RK4).

### 2. files
- `src/dynamics/orbit/orbit.hpp, cpp`
  - Definition of `Orbit` base class
- `src/dynamics/orbit/initialize_orbit.hpp, .cpp`
  - Make an instance of orbit class.	
- `src/dynamics/orbit/rk4_orbit_propagation.hpp, .cpp`

### 3. How to use
- Select `propagate_mode = RK4` in the spacecraft's ini file.
- Select `initialize_mode` as you want.
  - `DEFAULT`             : Use default initialize method (`RK4` and `ENCKE` use position and velocity, `KEPLER` uses init_mode_kepler)
  - `POSITION_VELOCITY_I` : Initialize with position and velocity in the inertial frame
  - `ORBITAL_ELEMENTS`    : Initialize with orbital elements
   
## 2. Explanation of Algorithm

### 1. `Propagate` function  
- The position and velocity of the satellite are updated by using RK4. As the input of RK4, the six-state variables are set. These state variables are the three-dimensional position [$x$, $y$ ,$z$] and three-dimensional velocity [$v_x$, $v_y$, $v_z$] at the inertial coordinate. Here, the inertial coordinate is decided by the `PlanetSelect.ini`
- As the force which works to the satellite motion is the external acceleration [$a_x$,$a_y$,$a_z$] calculated from the disturbance class or thruster class and the gravity force from the center planet, which is defined in `PlanetSelect.ini`. As a summary, the orbit is calculated as the following equation.
```math
\begin{align}
  \dot{x} &= v_x\\
  \dot{y} &= v_y\\
  \dot{z} &= v_z\\
  \dot{v}_x &= a_x-\mu\frac{x}{r^3}\\
  \dot{v}_y &= a_y-\mu\frac{y}{r^3}\\
  \dot{v}_z &= a_z-\mu\frac{z}{r^3}\\
  r &= \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}
\end{align}
```

## 3. Results of verifications

### 1. Verification of the error of Fourth Order Runge-Kutta method (RK4)
#### 1. Overview
- Verify the numerical integration error of the RK4 method.
- The output of the simulation was compared with the analytical solution.

#### 2. conditions for the verification
- The Verifications were conducted in the case of `simulation_step_s` and `orbit_update_period_s` were 0.1(sec), 1(sec), and 10(sec).
- The initial values of the propagation are as follows:
  ```
  initial_position_i_m(0) = 1.5944017672e7
  initial_position_i_m(1) = 0.0
  initial_position_i_m(2) = 0.0

  initial_velocity_i_m_s(0) = 0.0
  initial_velocity_i_m_s(1) = 5000.0
  initial_velocity_i_m_s(2) = 0.0
  ```
- This is a circular orbit, which period is about 20040(sec). The center of the orbit is Earth.
- As a reference, the analytical solution was used. The solution is as follows:
```math
x=R\cos(\omega t),y=R\sin(\omega t)\quad when~R=1.5944017672\times10^7, \omega=0.000313597243985794
```
- All of the effects of disturbance and environment were disabled.
- The simulation time is 60120(sec), which is approximately three-period. In addition, for a long-term test, the case in which simulation time is 200400(about 10 periods) was tested. The `orbit_update_period_s` of this case is 1(sec).

#### 3. results

  <img src="./figs/orbit_steptimesec_1.jpg" width = 400 alt="orbit_steptimesec_1">
  <img src="./figs/orbit_steptimesec_10.jpg" width = 400 alt="orbit_steptimesec_10">
  </figure>
</div>

- In the cases of `orbit_update_period_s=0.1` and `orbit_update_period_s=1`, the error is kept within $10^{-6}$ order. However, once the error grows, it will get bigger and bigger.
- In the case of `orbit_update_period_s=10`, the error quickly grows up to $10^{-4}$ order. 

<div align="center">
  <img src="./figs/orbit_steptimesec_1_longterm.jpg" width = 400 alt="orbit_steptimesec_1_longterm">
  </figure>
</div>

- In the long-term test result, it is clear that the error magnitude grows proportionally to the time.

#### 4. Others
- At first, the output of STK would be used for reference. However, it did not work well. Data were input as follows:
<div align="center">
  <img src="./figs/orbit_STKsettings.JPG" alt="orbit_STKsettings">
  </figure>
</div>

- However, the result is as follows:
<div align="center">
  <img src="./figs/orbit_STKresult.JPG" alt="orbit_STKresult">
  </figure>
</div>

- As this figure shows, the initial values in the result are slightly different from the input.
  + In the .sa files, the initial values of $x, y, z, v_x, v_y, v_z$ are converted into elements of orbit and stored. The error might occur in the process of this conversion.
