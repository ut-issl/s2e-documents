# Specification for Geomagnetic field model

## 1.  Overview
### 1. Functions 
+ `GeomagneticField` class calculates the geomagnetic field at the spacecraft's position from the IGRF model
+ This class also adds noise to emulate the difference between the IGRF model and the real world.

### 2. Related files
+ `src/environment/local/geomagnetic_field.cpp, .hpp`
  + `GeomagneticField` class is defined.
+ `src/environment/local/local_environment.cpp, .hpp`
  + `GeomagneticField` class is used here as a member variable of `LocalEnvironment` class.
+ `src/library/external/igrf/igrf.cpp, h`
  + A magnetic field in the ECI frame is calculated by the IGRF model.

### 3. How to use
+ Set a coefficient file path for the IGRF and random walk / white noise in .ini file
  - `coefficient_file`: File path to the IGRF coefficients table.
  - `magnetic_field_random_walk_standard_deviation_nT`: Standard deviation of the random walk noise
  - `magnetic_field_random_walk_limit_nT`: Limit of the random walk noise
  - `magnetic_field_white_noise_standard_deviation_nT`: Standard deviation of the normal random noise
+ Public functions
  + `CalcMagneticField`  : Update the magnetic field
  + `GetGeomagneticField_i_nT` : Return the magnetic field (nT) in the ECI 
  + `GetGeomagneticField_b_nT` : Return the magnetic field (nT) in the body-fixed coordinate


## 2. Explanation of Algorithm
+ IGRF calculates the magnetic field based on a spherical harmonic expansion of magnetic scalar potential $V$.
  + The coefficients of the spherical harmonic expansion of $V$ is updated by [IAGA](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/index.html). The latest version is the 13th generation, and S2E uses this version.
+ Please refer [here](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html#:~:text=The%20International%20Association%20of%20Geomagnetism,interior%2C%20its%20crust%20and%20its) for the details of IGRF.

## 3. Verification
### Overview
+ The  calculated magnetic field is compared with [Matlab's IGRF function](https://jp.mathworks.com/help/aerotbx/ug/igrfmagm.html) calculation in the ECI frame.

### 2. Conditions for the verification
1. input files
  - Default initialize files

2. initial values
  - To check the result in an example orbit, the EndTime was changed to 9000 s.
    ```
    simulation_start_time_utc = 2020/01/01 11:00:00.0
    simulation_duration_s = 9000
    simulation_step_s = 5
    orbit_update_period_s = 0.1
    log_output_period_s = 5
    simulation_speed_setting = 0
    ```
  - Especially, we chose the following TLE for orbit calculation (ISS orbit).
    ```
    tle1=1 25544U 98067A   20076.51604214  .00016717  00000-0  10270-3 0  9005
    tle2=2 25544  51.6412  86.9962 0006063  30.9353 329.2153 15.49228202 17647
    ```

### 3. Results
+ Results of S2E  
  <img src="./figs/Result_IGRF_S2E.png"  width="360" />

+ Error between S2E and MATLAB
  + The error is approximately 200â€•500 nT. This may be because the coefficients of S2E are 13th, but on the other hand, those of MATLAB are 12th.
