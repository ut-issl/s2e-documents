# Specification of Component class

## 1.  Overview
### 1. Functions
- The `Component` class is an abstract class to handle the electrical power and the update timing of components.
- This class has two virtual functions: `MainRoutine` and `FastUpdate`. Both are called periodically. Users can select the functions according to the required calling period.
  + The `MainRoutine` function is the components' main function. Most of the processing is handled in this function.
  + The `FastUpdate` function handles the processes that need to be computed in a high-speed cycle. So, users will use this function only when high-frequency disturbances need to be calculated (e.g., RW jitter).

### 2. Related Files
- Main file: `component.hpp`, `component.cpp`

### 3. How to use
- Inherit this class by the user's component class.
- The `ReactionWheel` in `S2E_CORE` is useful as a usage example of the `FastUpdate`.

## 2. Explanation of Algorithm
### 1. Constructor
#### 1. overview
- Users can set component update `prescaler` and power port. 

#### 2. inputs
- `prescaler`
  + `prescaler` determines the execution cycle of the `MainRoutine` function.
  + The period of `MainRoutine` equals to `SimTime::compo_update_interval_sec` $\times$ `prescaler`.
- `clock_gen`
  + `clock_gen` is an instance that simulates the clock of a component.
  + Users do not need to care about this.
- `power_port`
   + `power_port` is an instance that simulates the power supply
- `fast_prescaler`
  + `fast_prescaler` determines the execution cycle of the `FastUpdate` function.
  + The period of `FastUpdate` equals to `SimTime::compo_update_interval_sec` $\times$ `fast_prescaler`.
  + If you don't need to use `FastUpdate`, you don't need to specify this (it is set to 1 by default).

#### 3. algorithm
- N/A

#### 4. note
- N/A

### 2. `MainRoutine`
#### 1. overview
- Components' main function

#### 2. inputs
- `time_count`
  + `time_count` is incremented each time the `Tick` function is called.
  + Users can use this timing information when they need for their components.

#### 3. algorithm
- N/A 

#### 4. note
- All the components have to override the `MainRoutine` function.

### 3. `FastUpdate`
#### 1. overview
- This function handles the processes that need to be computed in a high-speed cycle.

#### 2. inputs
- N/A

#### 3. algorithm
- N/A 

#### 4. note
- `FastUpdate` function is not a pure virtual function, so components without fast calculation do not need to override this function.
- As explained in the `FastTick` section, `ITickable::needs_fast_update_` flag must be true to call `FastUpdate`. So, if users want to use `FastUpdate`, call `ITickable::SetNeedsFastUpdate(true)` in the constructor of each component.

### 4. `Tick`
#### 1. overview
- This function executes `MainRoutine`.
- `ClockGenerator` class calls this function.

#### 2. inputs
- `count`
  + `count` is incremented each time the `Tick` function is called.

#### 3. algorithm
- Execute `MainRoutine` when the `count` is divisible by the `prescaler`. By this mechanism, the execution period of `MainRoutine` is divided.

#### 4. note
- N/A

### 5. `FastTick`
#### 1. overview
- This function executes `FastUpdate`.
- `ClockGenerator` class calls this function.

#### 2. inputs
- `count`
  + `count` is incremented each time the `FastTick` function is called.

#### 3. algorithm
- Execute `FastUpdate` when the `count` is divisible by the `fast_prescaler`. By this mechanism, the execution period of `FastUpdate` is divided.

#### 4. note
- `ITickable::needs_fast_update_` flag must be true to call `FastUpdate`. So, if you want to use `FastUpdate`, call `ITickable::SetNeedsFastUpdate(true)` in the constructor of each component.
