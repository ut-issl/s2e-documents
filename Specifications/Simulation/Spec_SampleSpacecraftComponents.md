# Specification documents for Sample Spacecraft Components

## 1.  Overview

### 1. Functions
- The `SampleSpacecraftComponents` class is an example of component list mounted on the `SampleSpacecraft`.

### 2. Related files
- `src/simulation_sample/spacecraft/sample_spacecraft_components.cpp, .hpp`
  - `SampleSpacecraftComponents` is defined here.
- `src/simulation_sample/spacecraft/sample_ground_station.cpp, .hpp`
  - The instance of the `SampleSpacecraftComponent` class is made in this class.

### 3. How to use
- See [Sample Spacecraft](./Spec_Samplespacecraft.md) because the `SampleSpacecraftComponent` is used in the `SampleSpacecraft`.
- Details: TBW

## 2. How to make user defined components list installed on spacecraft
- `sample_components.hpp`
  - Define user defined components class. We use `SampleComponents` class here.
    - Users can name freely like `EquuleusComponents`, `UtSpacecraftComponents`, and others.
  - Inherit the `InstalledComponents` class.
    - Users need to define override functions for all pure virtual functions of the `InstalledComponents` class.
  - Add components you want as private members of this class.
  - In this sample, we defined many components here to show how to use them.

- `sample_components.cpp`
  - Write detailed process of the override functions
  - Constructor
    - In the constructor, users need to make instances of the components using `InitHoge` function for each component.
      - Currently, codes written here is confusing. We need to fix them to simplify the codes.
    - Users can also define the power line connection here.
  - Destructor
    - Delete all components here.
  - `GenerateForce_b_N` and `GenerateTorque_b_Nm`
    - If actuators are installed, please add the force or torque generated by the actuators here.
  - `LogSetup`
    - Please add to log list if you need.
