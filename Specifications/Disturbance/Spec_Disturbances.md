# Specification of Disturbances class

## 1.  Overview

### 1. Functions
- This class integrates all disturbances calculation.
- All disturbances are initialized in this class.
- Their update calculations are called in this class.

### 2. Related files
- `src/disturbances/disturbances.hpp`
- `src/disturbances/disturbances.cpp`

### 3. How to use
- When you make a new disturbance class, you need to register the new disturbance class in the `InitializeInstances` function.
- If you register your disturbance class correctly, the update function is automatically updated in the `Disturbances::Update` class, and the disturbance force and/or torque is added for dynamics propagation.


## 2. Explanation of Algorithm
### 1. `Update` function
#### 1. overview  
- This function calls the `Disturbance::Update` functions defined by each disturbance class.
- Generally, orbital disturbances depend on spacecraft position. Some disturbances depend on spacecraft attitude with respect to the disturbance sources. Therefore, there are two update timing in this function.
   - When the spacecraft position is updated, all disturbances are updated.
   - When the spacecraft attitude is updated, disturbances which depend on attitude are updated.

### 1. `InitializeInstances` function
#### 1. overview
- The instances of all disturbance classes are made and registered to the disturbance list in this function.
- The Earth only disturbances are registered when the selected center object is the Earth.
