# Surface Force ~Solar Radiation Pressure~

## 1.  Overview

1. Functions
   
   - `SolarRadiation` class inherits `SurfaceForce` base class and calculates air drag disturbance force and torque. 
2. Related files

   - SolarRadiation.cpp, .h : The `SolarRadiation` class is defined.
   - SurfaceForce.cpp, .h : The base class `SurfaceForce` is defined.
     - **Note**: `SurfaceForce` class inherits `SimpleDisturbance` class, and `SimpleDisturbance` class inherits `Disturbance` class. So, please refer them if you want to deeply understand the structure.
   - Init_Disturbance.cpp : Initialize sequence is defined.
   - Disturbance.ini: initialize file
3. How to use

   - Edit `Disturbance.ini` to change the structure parameters 
   - Instantiate the class in `Init_Disturbance.cpp` with `Disturbance.ini`
   - `Update` function of `SolarRadiation` is executed in the `Disturbances` class
   - Other classes and functions can use `GetTorque` and `GetForce` functions defined in the `Disturbances` base class

## 2. Explanation of Algorithm

  Write important algorithm for the class, the library, or the each function. Please use equations, figures, reference papers for easy understanding.

   1. overview

   2. inputs and outputs

      - inputs
        - $`v_{s}`$:Direction vector of the sun (s/c -> sun) at the body frame
        - $`P`$ Solar pressure at the position of the spacecraft [N/m^2]
      - setting parameters
        - $`\nu`$ : Total reflectance
          - $`\nu = 1-\alpha`$, where $`\alpha`$ is the absorption of the sun spectrum.
        - $`\mu`$ : Specularity. Ratio of specular reflection inside the total reflected light.
        - $`A`$ : Area of the surface
      - outputs
        -  $`C_{n}`$ and $`C_{t}`$

   3. algorithm

      - $`C_{n}`$ and $`C_{t}`$ are calculated as follows
        - $`\theta`$ is the angle between normal vector and the sun vector.

      ```math
      C_{n} = AP \left((1+\nu\mu)\cos^{2}{\theta}+\frac{2}{3}\nu(1-\mu)\cos{\theta} \right)\\
      C_{t} = AP(1-\nu\mu)\cos{\theta}\sin{\theta}
      ```

## 3. Results of verifications

1. Verification of perfect reflection case
   1. overview
      
      - In the perfect reflection case, direction of the SRP force will be opposite from the direction of the sun.
   2. conditions for the verification
      - We assumed that the structure of the spacecraft is 50 cm cube, whose optical property is the perfect specular reflection($`\nu=\mu=1`$). 
   3. results

      - We confirmed that the direction of the SRP force is opposite from the direction of the sun at the body frame.
