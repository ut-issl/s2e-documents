# Specification of Disturbance class

## 1.  Overview

### 1. Functions
- `Disturbance` is a base class for all disturbance classes.

### 2. Related files
- `src/disturbances/disturbance.hpp`

### 3. How to use   
- When you want to make a new disturbance class, you need to inherit this.
- Users need to define the `Update` function according to the target disturbance calculation. And update the members `force_b_N_`, `torque_b_Nm_`, `acceleration_b_m_s2_`, and/or `acceleration_i_m_s2_` in the function.
- If the disturbance does not depend on the spacecraft attitude, please set `is_attitude_dependent_ = false` to avoid unnecessary disturbance update.
