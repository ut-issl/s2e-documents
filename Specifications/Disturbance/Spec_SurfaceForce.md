# Surface Force

## 1.  Overview
1. Functions
   - S2E handles air drag and Solar Radiation Pressure(SRP) as surface force disturbances since both disturbances affect spacecraft surfaces. The structure of both equations is identical, but they have different coefficients. 
   - Thus, the `SurfaceForce` base class provides the structure of the equation, and `AirDrag` and `SolarRadiationPressureDisturbance` subclasses provide specific calculations with appropriate coefficients.
   - Currently, the `SurfaceForce` class supports multi-surface spacecraft without a self-shadowing effect. Users can select the number of surfaces.
   - For the detailed description of `AirDrag` and `SolarRadiationPressureDisturbance`, please refer [Air Drag](./Spec_SurfaceForce_AirDrag.md) and [Solar Radiation Pressure](./Spec_SurfaceForce_SolarRadiation.md).

3. How to use
   - Make a subclass that inherits the `SurfaceForce` class.
   - Define the `CalcCoefficients` function in the subclass.
   - Execute `CalcTorqueForce` in the update function of the subclass.

## 2. Explanation of Algorithm
1. Constructor
   1. overview
      - Initialize structure parameters
   2. inputs and outputs
      - input
        - List of `Surface` class which manages surface area, position, and normal direction.
        - Position vector of the center of gravity in the body fixed frame [m].
      - output
        - The instance of the class
   3. algorithm: NA
   4. note
      - The origin of all vectors defined here is the body-fixed frame. Users can define the origin of the body-fixed frame by themselves. If users want to define the origin as the center of gravity, they need to set `center_of_gravity_b_m = zero vector` in the `Structure.ini`. If users want to define the origin as a specific point, they need to carefully set all vectors to suit their definition.

2. `CalcTorqueForce` function
   1. overview
      - This is the main function to calculate the force and torque generated by the surface force disturbances.

   2. inputs and outputs
      - input
        - `input_direction_b`: direction of disturbance source at the body frame
        - `item`: parameter which decides the magnitude of the disturbances (Solar flux, air density)
        - Surface information defined in the constructor
      - output
        - `force_b_N_`: Force at the body frame (unit: N)
        - `torque_b_Nm_` : Torque at the body frame (unit: Nm)
        - Both variables are defined in the `SimpleDisturbance` base class

   3. algorithm
      - Let us consider the following coordinate on a surface for surface force calculation
        - $\boldsymbol{n}$ is the normal vector of the surface
        - $\boldsymbol{v}$ is the direction vector of the disturbance source (e.g., sun direction vector or velocity vector)

      <img src="./figs/SurfaceForce_overview.JPG" alt="SummaryCalculationTime" style="zoom: 70%;" />

      - $\boldsymbol{t}$ is the direction of in-plane force. 

      ```math
      \boldsymbol{t}=\frac{\boldsymbol{v}\times\boldsymbol{n}}{|\boldsymbol{v}\times\boldsymbol{n}|}\times\boldsymbol{n}
      ```

      - Surface force and torque acting on the surface is expressed as following equation
        - $\boldsymbol{r}_{s}$ is the position vector of the surface
        - $\boldsymbol{r}_{cg}$ is the position vector of the center of mass

      ```math
      \begin{align}
        \boldsymbol{F} &= -C_{n}\boldsymbol{n}+C_{t}\boldsymbol{t}\\
        \boldsymbol{T} &= (\boldsymbol{r}_{s}-\boldsymbol{r}_{cg})\times\boldsymbol{F}
      \end{align}
      ```

      - Detail of the $C_{n}$ and $C_{t}$ are defined by subclasses by using `CalcCoefficients` function

   4. note
      - NA
