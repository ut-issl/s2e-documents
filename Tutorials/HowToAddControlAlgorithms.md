# How To Add Control Algorithms

## 1.  Overview

- In [How To Make New Components](./Tutorials/HowToMakeNewComponents.md) tutorial, we have newly made components emulating codes in [S2E_CORE_OSS](https://gitlab.com/ut_issl/s2e/s2e_core_oss) and add the new components into own simulation scenario.
- We can simulate the behavior of spacecraft **free motion** and emulate the behavior of sensors and actuators. 
- This tutorial explains how to add **Control Algorithm** into the simulation scenario.
